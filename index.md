# ðŸ‘‹ Hello

Welcome to my notes. 

Browse through and you'll find a lot of content about topics that interest me.\
I update this repository regularly, since these are the notes I save and use on a daily-basis.

I plan on creating a logbook or a newsletter/RSS for updates as well, so you don't need to check around every time you want to see if there's something new.

## What is this?

This project is inspired by Robb Knight's [Intersect](https://intersect.rknight.me/), who was inspired by Nikita Volodoev's [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/).

To quote Nikita once again:

> This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online GitBook hosted on GitHub.

I personally use Jekyll + GitHub to run this thing (see [here for more](/docs/meta)).

## What is it about?

Well, it's about anything that interests me, really...

You'll see that I write mainly about [User Experience](/docs/ux), [Design](/docs/design), [Apple](/docs/apple) stuff, [Apps](/docs/apps) I try, but also [Movies and TV shows](/docs/movie-tv).

## Want to help?

- Send me interesting stuff you find around the web (but not only)
