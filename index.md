ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Fran and welcome to my notes, publicly available for everyone!

## What is this?

This project is inspired by Robb Knight's [Intersect](https://intersect.rknight.me/), who was inspired by Nikita Volodoev's [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/).

To re-quote once again:

> This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an online GitBook hosted on GitHub.
