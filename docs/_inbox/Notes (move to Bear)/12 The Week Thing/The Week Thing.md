## The workflow
- A mix of GTD plus other tactics learned over the years
- Brain dump everything in the inbox
- Organise your tasks using date, tags, and size
  - Keep it simple and manageable 
- Do not over commit. Every day you can only complete a maximum of:
  - 1 Large task
  - 2 Medium tasks
  - 3 Small tasks
- Plan your week using the weekly review method
  - Focus on one or two weeks at a time
- Time block your calendar
  - Schedule uninterrupted time to work on your tasks
- Take notes during your week so you can review them later

The two most important parts of the flow are:
- Review your week
  - Needs to be simple, concise, and “flexible”, like working on a piece of paper
  - Focus on managing the week more than completing tasks listed there
- Assign tasks to the day
  - Based on the S/M/L workflow
  - Drag and drop, suggestions, anything that can help the user plan their day 

The app workflow is based on a mix of GTD plus other practices I learned over the years.
Tuning this way of working took years of practice and I can say that it’s been tested in more than one work environment and it has proven to be extremely powerful. 
The core idea behind it is that we shouldn’t over commit: there is a limited amount of tasks that we can complete on a day. 
Being able to carve out enough uninterrupted time during the day to focus on these tasks will allow us to make a real impact in our life.

## Tasks
* Only in Today, users can complete a task by clicking on the icon on the left.
* In every other view, users have to open the task and then click on the circle icon
* Tasks can be scheduled only for the next two calendar weeks or added to a “to be scheduled” group that appears in Next Week
* Tasks can be:
  * Completed
  * Canceled
  * Moved to Today (if a task scheduled for yesterday has not been completed, it will automatically reappear today)
    * This should be indicated in the task
* Tasks can have
  * Title (mandatory)
  * Date
  * Notes
  * Checklist
  * Tag
## Helper
- Different “helper” icons will appear on the toolbar if available
- Ideas:
  - Triage tasks in the Inbox to quickly add a tag or a date
  - Explore available tasks that can be added to a date
  - Triage tasks in Sweep to easily delete or keep them

## Inbox
- Used to quickly save any task that comes into your mind
- By default every new task is added here
- If a date or a tag is assigned, the tasks disappears from the Inbox
- Use a review mode similar to Tinder to quickly assign your tasks

### Today 
- Only here tasks can be completed with simple click
- Tasks are organised in groups (large, medium, small)

* Week note is available to take notes during the week, and reflect on it on the last day of the week
- Past days can be viewed (if so, how?) but tasks can’t be left uncompleted.
  - If a task is left uncompleted it will be automatically moved to the next day (like in Things)
* Filters
* Helper
  * Help the user see which days don’t have 1L, 2M, or 3S tasks assigned to them and allow them to easily add tasks from the Backlog (or new ones) to them
