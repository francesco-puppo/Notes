Also known as the *Von Restorff Effect* or *Isolation Effect*.

This principle is particularly useful if the designer wants to direct the userâ€™s attention towards something.  

### Example: Grouping objects
If we have a group of objects where only one of them is dissimilar from the rest, that one item will automatically stand out.

### Example: CTA
Making the button stand out from the background will help a CTA stand out.
