## [[Good design is honest]]
In the digital world this is most important than ever. From pricing, to how a product is presented, and how it manages users data. Stay away from hidden costs and UX dark patterns.

## [[Good design is holistic]]
A good tool integrates well with the user’s workflow and it takes into consideration all the interactions they have with it. Users don’t work just within your product: they move from one tool to another. Keep in mind the bigger picture. 

## [[Good design is simple]]
A product should be obvious to use, as well as limited (see [[Maximum Viable Product]]) in what it offers. While the second point doesn’t always sit on the shoulders of the designer, you have to always aim for the first one. Don’t overcomplicate things.

## [[Good design is beautiful]]
Only after all the work has been done you can focus on the aesthetic details. Yes, looks do matter. Be proud of what you create.

## [[Good design is future-proof]]
If all the other principles are applied correctly, your software will survive the pass of time (digitally speaking, anyway). 
Even if this is a consequence of all the other points, it’s good to keep it in mind when designing. Do not fall prey to the latest design trends that don’t offer anything valuable to your product.
