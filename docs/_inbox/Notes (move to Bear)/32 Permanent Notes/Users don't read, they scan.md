There is a difference between how we think users explore our product, and how they actually behave.

What they actually do most of the times (if we're lucky) is *glance* at each new pace, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest and vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for.

There are always large parts of the page they don't even look at. 

Site owners often want to write “great literature” (or at least “product brochure”), while the user’s reality is much closer to “billboard going by at 60 miles an hour.”

Hence, we need to [[Design for scanning, not for reading]].
