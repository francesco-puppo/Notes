The concept of finished software: software you can use forever with no unneeded changes.

Finished software is not expected to change. And that's a feature.

> In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development.

> So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn’t change at all.

What's the first app that comes to mind? Well, [[Things 3]] off course!
