Sometimes the best tool for an individual may *also* be the best for the entire team, but it’s the latter that really matters.

## Figma
Using Figma as an example, is impressive to think about how much they revolutionised how companies work by allowing everyone, not *just* designers, to be involved in the design process.

Before Figma, designs where shared outside of the design tools, which increased the amount of friction, slowed down the entire process, and—automatically—kept certain people out of the loop.

Figma fixed this. Sharing designs is now as easy as sending a link.

This meant that everyone was more involved in the design process, but it allowed also the opposite: designers became more involved in the early steps of the development, since design can be drafted *simultaneously* with the product.
