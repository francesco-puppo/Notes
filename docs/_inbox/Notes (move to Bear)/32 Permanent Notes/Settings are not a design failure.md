# Settings are not a design failure

There’s a famous quote from Steve Jobs about settings being a design failure: the app should anticipate the user needs and not need any additional tweaking.

But users love settings:

> There is a difference between product settings that a product *needs* to get right and preferences that designers deliberately *shouldn’t* have a strong opinion on.  

It’s then useful to make a distinction between **Preferences** and **Settings**.

Preferences allow users to make the product *their own* and feel more at home. Giving users the opportunity to make these changes shows that you care about them and the amount of time they spend using your product. 

Settings and Preferences can also be an occasion to teach users how your product works. 

Apart from the difference between Preferences and Settings, one can dig deeper and also create Workspace Settings/Preferences and User Settings/Preferences, to make sure to cover every need.

Working on all these small details is not a distraction but makes sure users understand you love your product and want to make sure they feel at home. If they don’t feel comfortable, they will “quickly leave you for a more cozy place.”

> Come for the vision, stay for the details  

A great way to understand which settings might be introduced is to talk directly with your users.

Introducing small settings that improve user’s live will not change or disrupt your product direction.

> People have certain habits and preferences. \  
> Our job as a company is to create products that fit into people’s lives, not the other way around.
