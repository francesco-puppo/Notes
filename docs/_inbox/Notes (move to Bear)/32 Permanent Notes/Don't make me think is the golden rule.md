It’s the overriding principle—the ultimate tie breaker when deciding whether a design works or it doesn’t. The point is that every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand.

The distractions may be slight but *they add up*, especially if it’s something we do all the time like deciding what to click on.

**If you can’t make something self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.**

From [[Don't make me think - Steve Krug]]. Also known as *Krug's first law of usability*.
