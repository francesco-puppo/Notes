Whatever we interact with, we get some sort of [[Feedback]] that we process into an understanding of our environment. And we rely on experiencing these feedback's over and over again to reinforce that understanding. So most of our knowledge of how the world works goes into our subconscious mind and we rely habit and patterns to go about most of our daily lives.

- The same thing applies to interfaces.
	- To make a button on a screen feel ‘real’, we need to provide that immediate feedback to the action of tapping it.
- To understand if something needs feedback and how to implement it correctly, follow this list:
	- What input the user made (e.g., the user selected a specific button).
	- What response the system made (e.g., the system is submitting the data in user’s form).
	- When the response is completed and the system is ready for the next input (e.g., the data has been submitted). For slow response times, also indicate progress towards completion.
	- Whether the input was ultimately successful or not, and, if not, why and what the user can do about it.
	- System state modes or changes that may affect future user input or interpretation (e.g., dropped connection).
- Each of these should be on time, on target, and proportional in its own way.
