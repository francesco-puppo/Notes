Also known as the *Principle of Perpetual Habit*.

We, as users, depend on our habituated behaviours and perform most actions without really thinking (see: [[Don't make me think - Steve Krug]]).

> In a given situation, whatâ€™s worked for us before should doubtless work again.

==When creating new experience, keep certain constants in place==: but always remember that [[Clarity trumps consistency]].

==When new changes are made to a page layout, flag them==: let users know that there exciting news and, to benefit of these changes, they will have to adapt their usual behaviours a little bit.
