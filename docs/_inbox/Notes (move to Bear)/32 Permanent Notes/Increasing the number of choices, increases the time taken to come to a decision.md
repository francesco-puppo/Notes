Also known as *Hick’s law*.

Sometimes, Less is (actually) more: ==Don’t confuse the user by giving them an apparent limitless option of choices==, instead, structure a long list of options into a series of restricted choices.

When people are given several options of equal importance, they get overwhelmed. 
Rather than taking the time and effort to figure things out and make a choice, most people get confused and leave without making a decision.

Whenever users need to be presented with a number of choices, the best practice is to prioritise information and break them into steps or categories.

Hick’s Law can be applied to a multitude of interactions. Some example:
- It’s better to divide the navigation in categories and subcategories
- Same goes for checkouts and form fillings, where everything that is not really necessary should be removed (or put in a less prominent space)
