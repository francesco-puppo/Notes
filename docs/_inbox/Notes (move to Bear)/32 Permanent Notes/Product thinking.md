Product thinking is the skill of *understanding what makes a product useful and loved* by people.

The best product thinkers are eager to understand *why* a product works (or doesn’t) for different categories of people, or for the general public.

# Product thinking vs Design thinking 

Product thinking comes before design thinking and it should guide it.

Design thinking is a methodology, it involves designing ideas, mock-ups, and solutions but also doing research, prototyping, and testing. 

Product thinking, instead, is the skill of understanding and predicting what people want. 

While collecting and analysing data is useful, there will always be a point where you have to **rely on your instincts** and do what you believe works best for your audience.

# Understanding *why*

The starting point is asking why certain things work in a particular way, or people react in different ways to a certain product or feature.

But inquiring alone is not enough, **the key is understand the “why”** behind these reactions.

Some ways of doing this include:
- Reading books about human thinking/behaviour
- Dissecting cultural phenomena through articles, discussions, blogs
- Soliciting customers feedback in the process of building products
- Asking others why they have the reactions they do

Apart from this it’s fundamental, when possible, to confront the above with data from research (qualitative and quantitative) to arrive at a true understanding of the “why”.

# Practicing

- Keep asking *why* (see [Five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys))
- Every week, try at least one new product, feature, or service
- Every week, have at least one conversation or reflection about how a specific product decision impacts its intended audience

# Final notes

While it’s true that, most of the times, that best you can do is build sounded guesses or hypothesis, building a mindset of observation and inquiry, will help you not relying only on guesses. 

Developing a repeated process of learning, collecting data, gathering feedback, and iterating that both improves the product and the builder’s sense of what makes a great (or in some cases just successful) product.
