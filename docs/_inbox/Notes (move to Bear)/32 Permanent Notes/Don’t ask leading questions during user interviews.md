# Don’t ask leading questions during user interviews

People tend to provide socially desirable answers, so it’s better not ask questions that guide them towards that.

Leading questions impact the objectivity of the interview and, therefore, reduce the reliability of the results.

To avoid this issue, **ask the question as if you knew nothing about the topic**. Keep the question simple, neutral, and free from any words with connotations or emotions.

### Examples
- **Leading:** “Why would you prefer to use our product?”
- **Better:** “What are your thoughts about using our product?”
