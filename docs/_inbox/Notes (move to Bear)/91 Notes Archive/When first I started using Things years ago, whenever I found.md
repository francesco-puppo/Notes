When first I started using Things years ago, whenever I found something that didn’t work as expected, I also thought there was a flaw in the app, something missing that could be fixed by just adding a small new feature.

As time passed, I realised that I was wrong in most cases, and the balance between UX and features that the Cultured Code team was able to create is unrivalled.

To use Things at its best you have to stop looking for workaround and instead understand and apply the workflow designed by the developers. 
The best thing to do is to combine **GTD** (around which the app is designed) with **Deep Work** (which explains you how to use the other most powerful productivity app you have installed: your calendar).

**Apply GTD and keep it simple.** 
This will allow you to have a flexible system that needs little maintenance (which should happen mainly during your Weekly Reviews). I think that’s why tags are kept pretty simple. Allowing more intricacy would complicate the workflow and transform Things into something that doesn’t want to be.

**Use a calendar to schedule your tasks.** 
That’s why Things doesn’t have complete calendar integration: what you have in the app is just a list of tasks. Use the calendar to book time to focus on big tasks or batch multiple small tasks together.
Sort your tasks in Today’s view based on the logic that items that fall into This Evening should be kept for when your work day ends. Everything you get to do after 5pm, or whenever you clock out goes there. 

**Forget about reminders.** 
Again, use your calendar to plan your day. If something needs to happen at a specific time, I will definitely schedule it and book some time for it. Just in those rare cases where I want to be 100% sure I won’t forget it I will add a reminder to it (but it happens a few times per year).

I love the fact that Things’ interface is so simple and has just the right amount of features that are *really* needed. 
I know Cultured Code will, but I really hope they will maintain the same philosophy in future versions.
