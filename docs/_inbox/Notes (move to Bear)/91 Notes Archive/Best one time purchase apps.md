# Best one time purchase apps 

Mainly for Apple devices

This is a list of top-tier apps, which usually have a pretty high price point.
I also own a bunch of cheaper one time purchase apps but I didn’t include them in this list.

### Things
Things is probably my favourite app out there. It has a pretty high price but it’s definitely worth it[^You could say it’s actually pretty cheap considering I paid ~90€ in the last four years]. 
Once you understand how to use it *properly* (it’s easy but you have to stick to its workflow) you’ll wonder how you could manage your life without it. 
I find it insane that the app has been published around six years ago and, without many changes, it still has the best UX an UI compared to every other to-do app out there. 

### iA Writer
If you like writing you’ll love this app. When I had to choose between this and Ulysses I ended up with iA Writer for two reasons: it stores text based files locally (you can sync them with iCloud) and it has a minimalistic, highly opinionated design.
Open it and start writing. Immediately. With no distractions whatsoever.

### Pixelmator Pro
Unless you *really* need Photoshop or Illustrator, Pixelmator Pro is a great alternative for a much cheaper price. I use it those rare times I need to do something that Figma can’t. 

### CleanShot
Working as a UX Designer I use CleanShot every single day, multiple times per day. It’s one of the few apps that runs immediately as I turn on my MacBook. 
Grab a screenshot, edit or annotate it, add a nice border, and upload it. Everything in a beautiful and minimal interface. You can record videos too.
