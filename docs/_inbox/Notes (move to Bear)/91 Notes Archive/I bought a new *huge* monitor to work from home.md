I bought a new *huge* monitor to work from home.

While it might be too big (it most certainly is), I can already see how much better it is to work with it for a few different reasons:

- It allows me to focus: I am immersed in MacOS (see [[The Mac as a place, not a thing]])
- It's just better to work with so much screen estate: especially considering the work I do and I much I use Figma
- Looking straight ahead of me, instead of down on the laptop monitor, also has a beneficial effect and allows me to focus a lot more

All things considered, buying an external monitor was definitely the right choice. But maybe not this one. Even then, would 20cm make such a difference?

I just need to find a place where to place it when I don't use it.

I don't know... tomorrow I will test it properly and understand what to do with it...
