# Best subscription based apps 
Mainly for Apple devices

I have been reviewing the list of my subscriptions, in an attempt to gain some more clarity on where my money goes, and I found out there are some apps I really have a difficult time separate from, even if their subscription price is sometimes hundreds of euros per year.

This correlation between price and difficulty in finding an alternative is probably due to the high quality of these apps, and it’s why it’s so difficult to find valid and cheaper replacements.

### Apple Music
Not much to say about this one, just a few words about the alternative: Spotify, which has a similar price point.
Sure, subscribing to Spotify’s Duo plan would be cheaper when sharing it with my wife but I hate that videos and podcast are omnipresent in Spotify, when I just want to listen my music.
I also prefer how Apple Music allows you to organise your library, which is more in line with how I think about my music collection.

Apple Music costs ~130€/year

### Adobe Lightroom
The ability to organise and edit photos on all of my devices without having to set up anything is unbeatable.
Nonetheless, I am thinking about moving all of my photos to a local NAS hard drive. At that point I will look back into this and try to understand which other alternatives could fit my requirements.

### Readwise Reader
Reader from Readwise is a service I was sure I could get rid of. In the end there are plenty of RSS and read-later alternatives (much of them completely free or behind a one time purchase).
But when I got rid of it for a few months, I immediately understood why I am so attached to it.
Readwise Reader allows you to collect highlights and information in a streamlined way, with a really tight and frictionless workflow.
Sure, I could achieve the same by using a cheaper set of tools but that would require a lot more work on my side. And even if I think automating is often overrated, what you end up with when using Readwise Reader, is just an incredibly effective way to immerse yourself in your research and easily output valuable take aways. 

Reader costs ~100€/year (and it includes Readwise)

### mymind
I can’t explain how much I love mymind and how much it serves as an inspiration not just thanks to the items I collect in it but also when I explore why the app has been design in a certain way and the principles the team behind it set themselves to follow.
While I tried to collect inspiration in Pinterest, Notion, Raindrop, and a bunch of the new bookmarking tools that started appear in the last couple of years, nothing beats mymind.

Having said that, I downgraded my subscription to the cheaper tier (which is still ~60/y) since I already use Readwise Reader to save and highlight articles.

Mymind costs ~100€/year (~60€/year if you go with the Student for life subscription)

### Bear
This one is kind of an exception. While I do use Bear for all my research notes, I am sure I could easily move to an alternative (i.e. Obsidian) but since I have been using it for years and my subscription is based the old price, I much prefer to have a native and beautiful experience when writing my notes.

Bear costs (~15€/year if you still have the previous subscription)

## Everything else
Everything else I need is covered by free or one time purchase apps. See [[Best free apps]] and [[Best one time purchase apps]].

Sure there are still other subscriptions like Netflix, HBO Max, etc. but I manage them by unsubscribing and re-subscribing a few times per year, to not have too many running at the same time.

Cheaper subscriptions should be avoided since my workflow rarely benefits from them in an unchangeable way.
