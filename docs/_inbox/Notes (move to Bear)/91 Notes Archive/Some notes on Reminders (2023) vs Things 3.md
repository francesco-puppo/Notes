# Some notes on Reminders (2023) vs Things 3

```
This is a backup of a post I wrote on Reddit.

Since iOS 17 and MacOS Sonoma are out, I decided to try and move to Reminders (in combination with Notes) for my work related tasks and notes.

Here on Reddit I saw quite a few people that are thinking about switching, so I decided to write down a list of some opinions and things I noticed.

Your situation might be different from mine, and there is a lot of stuff that I don't need in Reminders, so keep that in mind when reading this. Some of these features might actually be really useful for you.

## TL;DR

Reminders, keeps improving (even if with just one update per year) but --Things is still a much better task manager--.

Apart from the workflow that Things “forces” you into, there are a lot of small or big issues in Reminders that you can’t always solve with a workaround.

And, even if you solve those, Things smooth UX and simple UI are still the best you can find in the App Store.

## My setup

Here a screenshot of my setup. Please note that it's not Sonoma, since it's from my work device.

## The big things

- --Projects:-- Since Lists in Reminders can’t be completed they shouldn’t be used as projects. My solution is to create a task (project) with subtasks (action items).A few problems with this:
  - --Subtasks-- can’t have their own subtasks, which is quite limiting when handling large projects.
  - --Smart Lists-- don’t have a way to filters parent tasks (I’m trying to add a -Project- tag to these items, but it’s a bit of manual work that I’d like to avoid).
  - Also, this makes the --List Template-- feature, in my opinion, basically useless.
- --Start Date and Deadline:-- While Reminders added a Remind earlier feature, this is not comparable with what Things offers.A task with a deadline, in Reminders, will still appear only on that day when the deadline is set.
- --Tasks hierarchy:-- When adding a subtask to Today, for example, it’s impossible to navigate back from it to its parent task. This is --extremely frustrating--.

## The small things

- --Workflow:-- Things 3 is designed around the GTD workflow and, once you get used to it, it’s really difficult to move away from it. Sure, you can use work-arounds in Reminders, but it’s not going to be as smooth.Currently I do this:
  - For the -Inbox-, I created
  - For -Someday- items, I created a tag that I can quickly access from the sidebar
  - For -Anytime- items, I created a smart folder, which filters all items that are not tagged with -Waiting- and don’t have a date assigned to them.
  - For -Next- actions, I use the flag option (this is almost the same as in Things, where I would use a tag).
  - It's nice that you can also recreate Things shortcuts to Inbox, Today, etc. by pinning these items in the sidebar.
  - As mentioned before, you can’t mark a List as completed and, also, you can’t mark a task as Canceled.
- --Quick Entry:-- While you can create a shortcut for this, it’s still not as good as with Things.
- --Group Today by time:-- In Reminders, it’s possible to automatically split Today’s view in three sections (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). When I realised these automatically set a reminder for a specific time of day, I quickly disabled it.
- --Badge Count:-- I strongly believe you should avoid being stressed by the apps you use, which is why I love Things feature of only show a badge count for items with a Deadline for today. In Reminders this is not possible.
- --Editing an item:-- Even if Reminders offers recognition of dates and tags (still, not as good as Todoist), learning a few keyboard shortcuts in Things offers a lot more power to quickly edit your tasks.

## The extra things

- Same as with Things, you can --drag and drop-- items to the Calendar app, which is great for time blocking.
- --Headers-- in lists allows you to split areas in sections, which is missing in Things. But since I can’t split down projects (as they are tasks with subtasks) this is less useful than headers in projects as Things has.
- --Smart Lists-- are a nice addition but for now I just recreated what we have in Things. I guess they would be essential if you try and fit both your personal and work related tasks in it, but I like to keep things separate.
- It’s nice to have a dedicated --URL field-- that appears in the main view for you to quickly jump into things.
- --Sharing something-- with Reminders automatically creates a link to that item (displayed with an the app’s icon in the reminder) which is nice.
- I try not to use --Priorities-- since I don’t want to spend too much time thinking “-Hey, is this a P1, or a P2?-”. Sometimes I give a task a P1 if it’s extremely urgent but I think a flag would be enough (but I already use that for -Next- actions.
- Having used it only for a short time, I haven’t tried --Kanban-- views yet, but I doubt I am going to use them much. It would be nice to use them when working on a big project but, since I don’t use Lists for that, it’s not going to be as useful.
- The new --Groceries Smart List-- is a nice addition but it’s clearly not something worth moving over for.
- Same as for Things, Reminders doesn’t work with --Focus modes--, which looks like a missed opportunity.
- I don’t use Location based reminders, Shared lists, or Remind me when messaging a person, so I don’t have anything to share about those.
