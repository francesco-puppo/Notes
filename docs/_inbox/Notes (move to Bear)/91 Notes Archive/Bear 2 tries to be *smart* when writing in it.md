Bear 2 tries to be *smart* when writing in it. If you add a quote, for example, the app automatically adds a space after you type `>` .
I understand the reasoning behind it, but I find it frustrating.

It actually takes me more time to remember and not enter a space after I start a line with `>`.

- Do I just need to get used to it?
- Is it a problem with one app that behaves differently from the rest?
  - But how does every other markdown app behave?
