# Best free apps 

Mainly for Apple devices

If you want to use quality apps, 99% of the times you will have to pay for them. That makes perfect sense and it’s something I don’t have any problem with. 

Having said that, here is a list of the free apps I use on my devices. 

### Apple 
Honestly, most of the app that come with your Apple device are good enough for your daily needs and I prefer them over most freemium bullshit.

- **Calendar**: It’s still the most beautiful calendar app. And it has just enough features.
- **Notes**: ideal for personal or even work notes. Not so great for research.
- **Weather**: unless you live in fucking tornado-valley than you can manage 
- **Clock**: C’mon, you don’t need to pay for an alarm app
- **Mail**: Have you actually tried it? It’s good. 

### Figma 
While I have a subscription to Figma at work, I nonetheless have a free account that I use for my own projects. Sure, it’s a bit more annoying to use, without libraries, but it’s still an amazing app you can use to create your designs. 

### Mindnode
Still the best looking and most intuitive to use mind mapping tool out there. The free tier doesn’t allow you to customise your maps and add notes and tags, but it does sync on iCloud.

### Plex
