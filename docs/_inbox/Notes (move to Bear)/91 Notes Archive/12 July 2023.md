Today I pulled the trigger and I bought iA /Writer for iPhone and iPad. Jesus Christ, it was 60€ but I just love this app, how it looks and well it’s been thought. 

Obviously I bought it as an excuse to push myself to write and create more. The last few days have been going well in that regard but let’s see how long it lasts. 

I think that one problem I have is that I don’t publish these writing. Receive feedback would be a great incentive for me to keep this going. 

Also, ==should I be writing this journal in English or Italian?==
