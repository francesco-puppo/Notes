# Browser-first apps allow for better collaboration 

In a cloud based app, files are stored in the cloud but edited locally. 
This can create problems when syncing and might force users to develop complex file names to distinguish between different versions of the same file. 

With a browser-first approach, instead, files are edited directly in the browser, without any need to notify the user about saving or syncing the file or solving conflicts. 

The actual *experience* of working on a file becomes native to the internet. This is what has happened with tools like Figma, Google Docs, etc.

In the case of **Figma**, this solves collaboration issues that, before it came out, where affecting every design team, especially when they had work with other teams (see [[The best tools enable collaboration that was previously unthinkable]])
