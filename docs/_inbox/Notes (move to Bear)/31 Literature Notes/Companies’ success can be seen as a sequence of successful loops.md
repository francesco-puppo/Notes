# Companies’ success can be seen as a sequence of successful loops

The ones that are successful in the long term were able to repeatedly find the next *sequencing loop*.

It’s all a matter of jumping from one loop to the next one.

Taking Figma as an example, one can say that their foundation is based on the concept that the design process is not *just* for designers.

## Figma
The team at Figma was able to identify an opportunity (a problem that could be solved) and create a winning product strategy starting from that.
Their starting idea was that the design process is not *just* for designers. 
But how did they decide to approach this?

* Architect Figma to be truly browser-first (which is different from just having storage be in the cloud) (see [[Browser first products allow for better collaboration]])
  * This forced them to lead in new technologies like WebGL and CRDTs 
* Focus on a specific user group: vector designers for digital products, in this case
* Implement collaboration features that can be used by anyone

By bringing different teams into Figma, they created a **cross-side network effect**, where two (or more) distinct groups get more value from a product as they keep growing. 
This network effects involve multiple groups, spread across the company, and help Figma metastasize throughout the entire organisation. 

---

Figma’s next challenge was to create not just local network effects (within companies), but global ones: it needed to become more useful to *all* users as it grew in scale.

That’s why they decided to focus so much on collaboration, since [[The best tools enable collaboration that was previously unthinkable]] .
Being true to their first inspiration, that the design process should not involve *just* the designers, they understood that [[The purpose of the tools we use at work isn’t to increase our individual productivity, but that of the entire team]]. 

Plugins are one of their answers: they realised that, as they grow and attract more customers, [[It’s impossible for a single company to build all the features and tools needed by each user]].

Thanks to its Community (which allows users to create plugins, as well as templates, or share designs) Figma can fight this drag: as users grow, more plugins will be created, making the product better for everyone, and spurring more designs to be created (virtuous circle).
