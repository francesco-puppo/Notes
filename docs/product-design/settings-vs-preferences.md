# Difference between settings and preferences 

Preferences are a subset of settings that designers don’t have a strong opinion on. They are small details that are simply a matter of taste and not just UX/UI.

> There’s a difference between product settings that a product needs to get right by default and preferences that designers deliberately shouldn’t have a strong opinion on.

Settings and preferences can also be broken down in workspace settings and user settings.
