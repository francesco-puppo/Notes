# Fast software is the best software

Good software is often fast but, most importantly, good software is _never_ slow.

Even if it’s probably the least valued asset, there is almost an implicit connection between speed and **reliability**.

Fast software is not always good software, but **slow software is never great**.

A software that is fast to use, in the end, improves the **efficiency** of the user as well.

## Using the right words

Speed also manifests in the language — the literal words — used in the software.
And this is done not by just using short words, but by using intuitive phrases and sentences.

> In recent years, macOS dialogs for closing an unsaved file have shifted from “Don’t Save, Cancel, Save” to “Delete, Cancel, Save.” This is only my opinion, but “Delete, Cancel, Save” makes less sense than “Don’t Save, Cancel, Save.” The option to “delete” implies something as having once been saved. Did I save this and forget I saved it? Or did it auto-save? I don’t know. Shake it any which way you like, I am still tripped up seeing this dialog when I close an unsaved file. It slows me down. Pressing delete feels violent. _Delete_. So final. I second guess — maybe I don’t want to delete? Maybe I _do_ want to save. When, no, I just wanted to “Don’t Save.”
