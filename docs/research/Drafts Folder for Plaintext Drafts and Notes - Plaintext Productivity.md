# Drafts Folder for Plaintext Drafts and Notes | Plaintext Productivity

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-3-01-drafts-folder-for-plaintext-18b6726e3fc) | [Read Original](http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-01-drafts-folder-for-plaintext-drafts-and-notes.html)

## Highlights

> Project name tags are preceded by "+" and context tags are preceded by "@". Dates are always captured in "yyyy-mm-dd" format in file names.

> I don't bother using tags for my journal entry files, typically because I don't often have a plan for them before I write them. I do try, however, to tag every project-specific file I write, even if I have to rename them to add the tags.
