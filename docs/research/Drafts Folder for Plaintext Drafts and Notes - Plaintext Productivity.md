## Highlights

> Project name tags are preceded by "+" and context tags are preceded by "@". Dates are always captured in "yyyy-mm-dd" format in file names. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-3-01-drafts-folder-for-plaintext-18b6726e3fc#e6342ad0-76fc-44c8-9e7f-5486ae4aa808)  ^e6342ad0

> I don't bother using tags for my journal entry files, typically because I don't often have a plan for them before I write them. I do try, however, to tag every project-specific file I write, even if I have to rename them to add the tags.
