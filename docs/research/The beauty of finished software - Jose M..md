## Highlights

> the concept of finished software — a software you can use forever with no unneeded changes.
> 
> Finished software is software that’s not expected to change, and that’s a feature!

> If we see an app with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might be dead.

> Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable, with new bugs. Even if it’s genuinely better, there’s the learning curve.

> In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development.
> 
> So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn’t change at all.
