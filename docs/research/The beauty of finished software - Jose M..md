## Highlights

> the concept of finished software — a software you can use forever with no unneeded changes.
> 
> Finished software is software that’s not expected to change, and that’s a feature! [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-beauty-of-finished-software-jose-m-18b90a6bcf7#82147b89-9533-4d41-a3e0-c81d757e8b72)  ^82147b89

> If we see an app with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might be dead. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-beauty-of-finished-software-jose-m-18b90a6bcf7#87707db9-6fa3-439b-8a4a-a37d8b28feca)  ^87707db9

> Sometimes, a software upgrade is a step backward: less usable, less stable, with new bugs. Even if it’s genuinely better, there’s the learning curve. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-beauty-of-finished-software-jose-m-18b90a6bcf7#f68b3ffc-777c-4272-afb0-1f81e39f504c)  ^f68b3ffc

> In a world where constant change is the norm, finished software provides a breath of fresh air. It’s a reminder that reliability, consistency, and user satisfaction can coexist in the realm of software development.
> 
> So the next time you find yourself yearning for the latest update, remember that sometimes, the best software is the one that doesn’t change at all. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-beauty-of-finished-software-jose-m-18b90a6bcf7#be3ab043-818a-4fec-9e40-b896f407121d)  ^be3ab043
