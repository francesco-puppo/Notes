## Highlights

> Research shows that, when introduced to an application or system, users prefer to start using it immediately, undeterred by its level of complexity. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#65b76db7-cb51-4a92-a669-3adff971968c)  ^65b76db7

> Users are more motivated to begin their tasks than spend time consuming tutorials, documentation, or other types of help or setup content. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#217a4fe7-5768-4f1e-83f0-b920a2504788)  ^217a4fe7

> Support users’ preference to begin exploring the interface immediately by allowing them to learn the interface through trial and error, without that experimentation resulting in loss of work or irreparable damages. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#5339124b-c16f-41db-909f-f2dd1196fe77)  ^5339124b

> Many users will [satisfice](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/satisficing/), meaning that they will keep using satisfactory (often inefficient) ways of accomplishing tasks, rather than invest time in seeking out optimal solutions for their workflows. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#6981f841-f746-4466-b27f-901f45e71a8a)  ^6981f841

> Help users transition to more efficient methods and break their ingrained behavioral patterns by finding unobtrusive ways to communicate faster, more efficient methods for their tasks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#27c0dc43-2b87-4029-b110-3e241370889a)  ^27c0dc43

> For example, instead of relying solely on lengthy tutorials or manuals (even well-written ones), embed in-context learning cues for [accelerators](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ui-accelerators/) or additional functions throughout the application. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#41d9360d-f947-462c-8334-3b3495af8549)  ^41d9360d

> need to analyze data to look for answers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#cf131504-365f-4411-9387-a9973c134701)  ^cf131504

> Allow users flexibility in their task sequence by avoiding rigid, linear workflows that force users through a set of actions from start to finish with no escape hatches or flexibility in sequence. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#cb79f5dc-b6c7-444e-9b7b-a32a5fa17843)  ^cb79f5dc

> Complex-app users often face long waits and frequent interruptions to their work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#692eeb46-edde-43e0-ade7-2711f0303c9d)  ^692eeb46

> Offload working-memory burden and help users resume tasks after interruptions or breaks in workflow by enabling users to keep a record of their actions and thought processes during their work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#0a9d7103-856e-4054-b36f-b2cefae78d76)  ^0a9d7103

> Complex-app users typically work across multiple tools and multiple workspaces. Even if users rely mostly on one specialized application for the majority of their work, they frequently switch applications for a number of reasons; for example, to gather data from online databases [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#551408b7-2b28-4517-895f-78ad46228eb0)  ^551408b7

> Even within the primary application, users may transition between different environments or workspaces due to software addons or other optional packages that enable various specialized functions within the application. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#2ae24036-d879-4fbb-ae76-fca4463c026a)  ^2ae24036

> Reduce the burden of tool switching by supporting the transition from one environment to another, both inside and outside the primary application. 
> 
> One way to reduce the burden of tool switching is by simply accepting this ecosystem and designing connection points between the primary application and frequently used third-party tools. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#5697e8c0-f65e-4610-ad8a-3afc974eb7c7)  ^5697e8c0

> Complex apps are often designed to accommodate a broad range of uses. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#cdeb9d1a-96b4-419c-b8bf-638932ec85ff)  ^cdeb9d1a

> This diversity of usage scenarios makes complex applications very powerful on the one hand, but often very cluttered, on the other. Additionally, complex applications must often support both novice and expert users at the same time, and expert users may need advanced features that infrequent or novice users rarely access. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#72c6512d-e0e9-4028-a2f0-8e76ec6602f9)  ^72c6512d

> Help users manage the choice, feature and function overload prevalent within complex applications by minimizing the appearance of clutter within the interface without reducing the capability of the application. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#6e41d93c-24af-4dda-9918-4050d7350d9d)  ^6e41d93c

> Even when clutter is effectively reduced within an interface, not all elements and information can (or should) be displayed at once. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#7bf8824b-7d07-4a6e-bc81-9d84cf19dc74)  ^7bf8824b

> Ease the transition between primary and secondary information and help users contextualize primary information by allowing users to access and view supplemental information without leaving the primary screen or environment. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#03d3fe0d-92d3-4f7f-b731-30f9808257c0)  ^03d3fe0d

> Many of the tasks performed by complex-app users require a high degree of visual search. To name a few examples: Users may have to locate and distinguish relevant data across tabular views in huge tables. System alerts must draw attention to relevant parts of the interface so that users can notice and rectify underlying conditions in a timely manner. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#54e9f17f-61ac-4668-a639-c0f0513e711a)  ^54e9f17f

> Help users find and act upon important information by making critical elements visually salient, (i.e., making them stand out from surrounding elements). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/8-design-guidelines-for-complex-applications-18bdc7ec770#18fad7fd-b9af-4a3c-9e6e-682473eb87cd)  ^18fad7fd
