# A Plain Text Personal Organizer - Daniel Lucraft

Interesting because it starts with a one-file-only approach but then sees its limits and proposes a folder-based one.

## Highlights

> The idea really is to store _all_ of this information in a _single_text file.

> the advantages which include:
> 
> * everything is in one place,
> * it is easily synchronized between computers,
> * it can be used in any text editor,
> * the format will never be obsolete.

> The drawbacks can be major however:
> 
> * must be synchronized religiously,
> * the file can get VERY large,
> * can be hard to find stuff in a large file, even with search,
> * ideas can get lost among all the other items.
