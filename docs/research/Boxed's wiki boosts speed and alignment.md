## Highlights

> if only a few people felt comfortable editing the company's wiki, it would get stale and inevitably die. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-e-customeriomail-com-e-c-ey-jlb-w-fpb-f-9-p-zci-6-im-rn-vh-18bc878a1d8#93ba614e-464e-4596-a2a0-217e04c9ffe3)  ^93ba614e

> The average wiki gets outdated and useless fast. It's published by a couple people to be consumed by many, making it feel more like a static reference book.

> The best wikis are interactive. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-e-customeriomail-com-e-c-ey-jlb-w-fpb-f-9-p-zci-6-im-rn-vh-18bc878a1d8#b437d202-cecf-45e9-968c-6107d07045ab)  ^b437d202
