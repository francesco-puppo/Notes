# 10 things we've learned about A/B testing for startups

## Highlights

> Booking.com runs an estimated 25,000 tests per year. [Only 10%](https://hbr.org/2020/03/building-a-culture-of-experimentation) of them generate positive results.

> * An experiment _isn't a failure_ if it doesn't produce the results you expected.
> * An experiment _is only a failure_ when the team doesn't learn anything from it.

> ### Good A/B tests have 5 traits ✅
> 
> 1. **A specific, measurable goal**  
> An ambiguous goal leads to an unclear A/B testing process. It isn’t clear what A/B test to run to “increase sales.” “Increase demo bookings from the sales page” is actionable.
> 2. **A clear hypothesis about why your change will achieve your goal**  
> A good hypothesis explains why you’re making the change, and what you _expect_ to happen. Without one, how will you know if your test was successful?
> 3. **Test as small of a change as reasonably possible**  
> Change too much and it’s unclear which (if any) change made a difference, and why. That said, a change is _too small_ if it’s unlikely to impact user behavior, so choose carefully.
> 4. **A sufficiently large sample size**  
> You need a large enough sample size for your test and control groups for them to be statistically significant. We calculate this automatically in PostHog, btw.
> 5. **A long enough test duration**  
> Depends on your sample size and confidence level, but a good rule of thumb is a minimum of one week and a maximum of one month.

> Group your changes in as few places as possible, use feature flags to control who sees your changes, test only those involved in the test see the changes, and don’t capture metrics from unaffected users.

> four simple questions before running any test:
> 
> 1. What problem are you trying to solve?
> 2. Why should we solve it?
> 3. How should we solve it? (optional)
> 4. What if this problem didn’t exist? (optional)

> * **Data over debate.** Data trumps opinions, even for executives. You need buy-in from all levels of the organization.
> * **Experiment with everything**. Say “I don’t know” and find out.
