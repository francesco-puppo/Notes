## Highlights

> It might be great for the product team, but it’s bad for customers. And ultimately, what’s bad for customers is bad for the company. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-customers-hate-mv-ps-make-a-slc-instead-18b855f5851#25d79006-a2fc-4a3a-8122-69cf1cdf26a2)  ^25d79006

> “Simple” is good, “incomplete” is not. The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product, _as-is_. Not because it’s version 0.1 of something complex, but because it’s version 1.0 of something simple. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-customers-hate-mv-ps-make-a-slc-instead-18b855f5851#e9eb1c83-ffd8-4a15-bfb4-b48abb50ee4b)  ^e9eb1c83

> years ago I named what I believe is the correct alternative to the MVP: Simple, Lovable and Complete (**SLC**). We pronounce it “Slick.” As in: “What’s the ‘Slick’ version of your idea?” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-customers-hate-mv-ps-make-a-slc-instead-18b855f5851#9c432761-c3e6-49de-b564-6c89dab52927)  ^9c432761

> An MVP that never gets additional investment is just a bad product. A SLC that never gets additional investment is a good, if modest product. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/your-customers-hate-mv-ps-make-a-slc-instead-18b855f5851#792195d6-66e9-4a92-9480-4fa739af0d58)  ^792195d6

> Not every product has to become complex. Not every product needs new major versions every two quarters. Some things can just remain simple, lovable, and complete.
