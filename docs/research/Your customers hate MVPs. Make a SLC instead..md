# Your customers hate MVPs. Make a SLC instead.

## Highlights

> It might be great for the product team, but it’s bad for customers. And ultimately, what’s bad for customers is bad for the company.

> “Simple” is good, “incomplete” is not. The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product, _as-is_. Not because it’s version 0.1 of something complex, but because it’s version 1.0 of something simple.

> years ago I named what I believe is the correct alternative to the MVP: Simple, Lovable and Complete (**SLC**). We pronounce it “Slick.” As in: “What’s the ‘Slick’ version of your idea?”

> An MVP that never gets additional investment is just a bad product. A SLC that never gets additional investment is a good, if modest product.

> Not every product has to become complex. Not every product needs new major versions every two quarters. Some things can just remain simple, lovable, and complete.
