# Assumed Audiences

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-maggieappleton-com-assumed-audience-18bd27bc26c) | [Read Original](https://maggieappleton.com/assumed-audience)

## Highlights

> At the beginning of many of my posts, I have a small informational box that tells you my **assumed audience** â€“ who I think I'm writing this piece for.

> These small boxes free both of us of unspoken obligations and expectations. As the writer, I am now free to write for an informed audience without defining every term and qualifying every statement. We can jump straight to the gritty details and contentious debates rather than doing a full literature review of the field.
