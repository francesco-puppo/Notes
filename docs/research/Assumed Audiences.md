## Highlights

> At the beginning of many of my posts, I have a small informational box that tells you my **assumed audience** – who I think I'm writing this piece for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-maggieappleton-com-assumed-audience-18bd27bc26c#995b2016-a488-46bd-8e72-7805b07bcc67)  ^995b2016

> These small boxes free both of us of unspoken obligations and expectations. As the writer, I am now free to write for an informed audience without defining every term and qualifying every statement. We can jump straight to the gritty details and contentious debates rather than doing a full literature review of the field.
