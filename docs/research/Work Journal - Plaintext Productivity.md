# Work Journal | Plaintext Productivity

## Highlights

> Throughout history, intelligent people have kept records.

> Write things down. It helps you think, it records your course of action, and having those thoughts and actions written down may be useful if a course correction is needed down the line.

I wrote an article about this (ðŸ‘‰ [Writing is thinking](https://iamfran.com/archives/writing-is-thinking)).

> Beyond being a record of activities and intentions, a journal is is also a powerful tool for providing _focus_. It provides you a safe space to type things out while you start to gather your thoughts about them. Doing so encourages _planning_, _strategizing_, and _forward thinking_.

> A work journal is a private, informal way to structure your thoughts and plan for the day, week, or month ahead.
