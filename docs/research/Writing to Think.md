## Highlights

> Writing forces you to slow down, focus your attention, and think deeply. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#fbbf3998-67c3-4fa4-a376-11af4500c114)  ^fbbf3998

> Mortimer Adler once said, “The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#2863de97-f8e5-4d5c-834a-481f391caf51)  ^2863de97

> writing about something complicated and hard to pin down acts as a test to see how well you understand it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#eb60e7a6-87bb-4611-9c0c-3845b6a1b33e)  ^eb60e7a6

> Most organizations see PowerPoint and writing as interchangeable. They are not. Powerpoint masks poor thinking. Just because presentations are easy to create doesn’t mean the person creating them understands what they are talking about. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#c777120c-249c-490a-93cf-44aaeaa8df1a)  ^c777120c

> Anyone who’s ever revised a piece of writing and done it well knows the pain of having to kill their darlings. But deleting, in writing and life, is a valuable tool. When you write, you develop an attachment to the text you produced only because you produced it. Choosing to discard writing forces you to reconcile between what is true and what you wrote, which can lead to tremendous personal growth both in writing and in life. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#5d27950f-fc81-4ea1-a018-0da40a7514c5)  ^5d27950f

> Deciding what to pay attention to and, more importantly, what to overlook and remove, is one of the most critical skills. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#811772d7-49d7-4137-9a45-fa683241da1a)  ^811772d7

> Perhaps the best reason to write is that it offers a vehicle for discovering deeper insights. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#a586be9a-9c6d-4b3a-9dc0-46efacb18260)  ^a586be9a

> Practically speaking, writing forces you to take a complicated and ill-defined problem and compress it into something more manageable. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#ad72bdbe-c7cf-45d8-8f1b-5d6fe9cbd144)  ^ad72bdbe

> Paul Graham put it this way: “A good writer doesn’t just think, and then write down what he thought, as a sort of transcript. A good writer will almost always discover new things in the process of writing.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#a77f8782-3cdd-4ab5-b771-355f2b0ac455)  ^a77f8782

> The insights you discover are not limited to the subject you write about. You also learn about yourself. Writing doesn’t just convey your ideas, it conveys a part of you. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#4a3bc9c1-cebe-4b47-9979-fb078b2f567b)  ^4a3bc9c1

> Many things can be done by tools that write for you, but they won’t help you learn to think, understand deeper, or solve hard problems. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#79212d5f-c721-44ca-8342-d5cbca87c272)  ^79212d5f

> in a world where intellectual labor is increasingly outsourced to tools, the human aptitude for clear thinking and unique insights will become all the more valuable. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-fs-blog-writing-to-think-18c147dc5bb#a3efd6cd-c5b7-4496-89a0-3b731c55c006)  ^a3efd6cd
