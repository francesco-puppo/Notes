## Highlights

> The "@Working" folder is for _shortcuts_ to the project folders and files I am working on presently. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-3-02-file-folder-structure-for-l-18b67225daa#3ed73462-4b59-4b5f-a0d3-fda790017657)  ^3ed73462

> All plaintext notes and drafts are kept in a single "@Drafts" folder within each year. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-3-02-file-folder-structure-for-l-18b67225daa#81fc77cd-1dd2-457b-8673-dc4da358d121)  ^81fc77cd

> It would be simpler to have a single "[@Drafts](http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-01-drafts-folder-for-plaintext-drafts-and-notes.html)" folder, applicable to all years, at the same level of "@Archive". I chose not to because I write hundreds of drafts and notes every year, and those that are over a few months old are stale and not referenced much.
