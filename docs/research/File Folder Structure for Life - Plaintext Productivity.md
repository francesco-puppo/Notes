# File Folder Structure for Life | Plaintext Productivity

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-3-02-file-folder-structure-for-l-18b67225daa) | [Read Original](http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-02-file-folder-structure-for-life.html)

## Highlights

> The "@Working" folder is for _shortcuts_ to the project folders and files I am working on presently.

> All plaintext notes and drafts are kept in a single "@Drafts" folder within each year.

> It would be simpler to have a single "[@Drafts](http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-01-drafts-folder-for-plaintext-drafts-and-notes.html)" folder, applicable to all years, at the same level of "@Archive". I chose not to because I write hundreds of drafts and notes every year, and those that are over a few months old are stale and not referenced much.
