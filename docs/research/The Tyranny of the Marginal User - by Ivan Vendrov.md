## Highlights

> Reddit and Craigslist remain incredibly useful and valuable precisely because their software remains frozen in time.

> _Tyranny of the Marginal User_.
> 
> Simply put, companies building apps have strong incentives to gain more users, even users that derive very little value from the app.

> But Marl will never click through any of your hamburger menus, never change any setting to a non-default. You might think Marl just doesn’t know about the settings.

> Marl can also be a state of mind. We’ve all been Marl at one time or another - half consciously scrolling in bed, in line at the airport with the announcements blaring, reflexively opening our phones to distract ourselves from a painful memory.

> the structure of the digital economy means most of our digital lives are designed to take advantage of this state.

> A substantial fraction of the world’s most brilliant, competent, and empathetic people, armed with near-unlimited capital and increasingly god-like computers, spend their lives serving Marl.

> consumer software tools that enhance human agency, that serve us when we are most creative and intentional, are often built by hobbyists and used by a handful of nerds.
