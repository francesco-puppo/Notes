## Highlights

> **each new feature made the old features more difficult and error-prone**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nngroup-com-articles-reduce-redundancydecrease-duplica-18bdc92d064#4d6f8092-fb78-4c6d-b7ff-32e2305d41f9)  ^4d6f8092

> Simplicity may be the single most important usability guideline. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nngroup-com-articles-reduce-redundancydecrease-duplica-18bdc92d064#ea51ad35-7a71-4fda-8f3a-37aa417638cb)  ^ea51ad35

> If users overlook a link, you can move it or make it more prominent rather than duplicate it. However, a truer solution might be to downplay other distracting design elements.

> Remove features and links that are less important to users. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nngroup-com-articles-reduce-redundancydecrease-duplica-18bdc92d064#2065d4ef-05ff-4f95-b9e3-a52f267f7596)  ^2065d4ef

> Still, too many cross-references will create an overly complex interface and prevent users from understanding where they are and what options they have at that location.
