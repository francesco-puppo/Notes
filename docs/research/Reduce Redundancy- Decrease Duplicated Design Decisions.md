# Reduce Redundancy: Decrease Duplicated Design Decisions

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-www-nngroup-com-articles-reduce-redundancydecrease-duplica-18bdc92d064) | [Read Original](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/reduce-redundancydecrease-duplicated-design-decisions/?lm=complex-apps-workflows&pt=youtubevideo)

## Highlights

> **each new feature made the old features more difficult and error-prone**.

> Simplicity may be the single most important usability guideline.

> If users overlook a link, you can move it or make it more prominent rather than duplicate it. However, a truer solution might be to downplay other distracting design elements.

> Remove features and links that are less important to users.

> Still, too many cross-references will create an overly complex interface and prevent users from understanding where they are and what options they have at that location.
