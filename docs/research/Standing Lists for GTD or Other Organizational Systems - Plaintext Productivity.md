## Highlights

> "Someday/Maybe" list is the landing zone for all those ideas, notably the ideas that you can't act upon immediately. Write them down and go back to the list regularly (say, in your [weekly review](#weekly-review)) to pick them up again when the time is right. you don't have to expend energy remembering these ideas, just write them down whenever they come and leave them in your system until you need them.
> 
> I keep a "Someday Maybe.md" file in my [@Drafts](http://plaintext-productivity.net/3-01-drafts-folder-for-plaintext-drafts-and-notes.html) folder, and refer to it and update it when I do my weekly review.

> Similar to a weekly review, an annual review is a journal entry you make at the beginning or end of the year. It is backward looking and forward looking, and focuses on long-term (one year) accomplishments and goals.

> ## Personal manifesto
> 
> Who are you? What do you stand for? What values drive you? What are your principles and motives? What are the important elements of your character? How do you cope with adversity? What do you want to achieve in your life or career?
