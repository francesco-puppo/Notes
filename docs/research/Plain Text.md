# Plain Text

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/plain-text-18b67099ef3) | [Read Original](https://brajeshwar.com/2022/plain-text)

## Highlights

> Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It’s searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It’s unstructured. It works when web servers are down, or the Internet is not working.

> “Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow.”
