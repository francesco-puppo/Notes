## Highlights

> Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It’s searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It’s unstructured. It works when web servers are down, or the Internet is not working. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/plain-text-18b67099ef3#5e4e9634-fa50-4885-ac75-6a946707124e)  ^5e4e9634

> “Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/plain-text-18b67099ef3#b69cfc8c-024f-49cb-b292-8129890164f4)  ^b69cfc8c
