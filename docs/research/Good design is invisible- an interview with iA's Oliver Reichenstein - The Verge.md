# Good design is invisible: an interview with iA's Oliver Reichenstein | The Verge

## Highlights

> I think the experience of being illiterate and then slowly growing back into society has made me a better designer.

> For the first time, I was able to say and do what I felt, and no one tried to correct me back to the “standard” way.

> Websites were — and still are — always too noisy for my taste.

> I learned an awful lot from Khoi Vinh’s blog.

> The main old-school design influences on iA’s work come mostly from typographers. I grew up in Switzerland, so Frutiger, Ruder, Tschichold, Müller-Brockmann, and Miedinger are part of my visual DNA.

> Working in Japan, I learned to see what I disliked about our design culture — the typical Swiss coldness, the lack of emotion and loveliness, the often clumsy use of color, the loneliness — from a slightly different angle. I learned to see its weaknesses and strengths, and tried to find ways to evolve it.

> I learn more from observing and discussing with him than from any book I have read in the last couple of years.

> Japanese designers grow up drawing Kanji, which lets them develop a much more delicate eye in dealing with white space, gray value, and contrast. Japanese have slightly different color vocabulary and that means: a slightly different sense of color.

> The principles of good design have not changed. Dieter Rams said: “Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.”

> You need to design your products in a way that requires minimal input, and delivers maximal output.

> Whether you design or set type, what you do is designing text for optimal performance.

> few type setters understand that if they have no clue about microtypography (legibility), they cannot excell in macrotypography (readability).

> Good user interface design takes care of irritations before they appear

> One reason why Japanese web and app design feels weak is that technology requires good active and passive knowledge of English. English is the lingua franca of contemporary web and app development, both of our tools and our discourse.

> Nothing is more destructive to good design than group thinking and collective decision making

> While

> to most people good design is invisible. Group decisions focus on the visible, bad aspects of design.

> UI design for operating systems is the highest form of GUI and interaction design. It is incredibly hard to create something iconic and functional on that level of the user interface.

> Being able to freely choose your clients without ifs or buts is the only way to do work in a meaningful relationship.

> The vision for what we do has stayed the same since I founded iA back in 2005: Reduce to the essence.
