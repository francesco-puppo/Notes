# How I Organize My Todo.txt File | Plaintext Productivity

[Read on Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8) | [Read Original](http://plaintext-productivity.net/1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt-file.html)

## Highlights

> instead of writing "write research paper for client", I would break it down into several tasks: "begin online research", "write outline for report", "discuss outline with boss", "write first draft of report", "edit report", and so on.

> I use an "+Admin" project as a catch-all for the odds and ends that don't belong in an actual work project, such as signing up for benefits.

> At these points, what my task list and its priorities are telling me I cannot work on anything important, or that everything is top priority. Neither helps me decide what I should do next. In both cases, the priority system failed, which to me is worse than not helpful, it is demotivating.

> My Todo.txt priorities are _my_ priorities, not "how important" the task is.

> Here is how I use Todo.txt priorities:
> 
> * **A**: The task I am working on now. My current or next action. Ideally, I will always have only one task in category A. Why do I bother with this? I get interrupted at work and have to return to what I was working on, sometimes minutes or hours later. Having my current action split out and at the top of my to-do list helps me get back on track more quickly.
> * **B**: Tasks that I plan to do today.
> * **C**: Tasks that I plan to do this week.
> * **D**: Tasks reserved for next week. I tend to use this category only on Fridays, and even then almost never use it.

> Shifting priorities around using the keyboard works much faster than setting due dates and clicking on stars or other priority markers I have used in other task lists.

> Getting Things Done tends to make you believe that every "next action" must be tagged with both a project and a context, but that is not really true. If contexts are critical to you, use them. If not, don't.

> Your task list should be tailored to your needs, and help you do work, not be too much work in and of itself.
