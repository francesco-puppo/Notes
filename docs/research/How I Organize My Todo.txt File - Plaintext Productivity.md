## Highlights

> instead of writing "write research paper for client", I would break it down into several tasks: "begin online research", "write outline for report", "discuss outline with boss", "write first draft of report", "edit report", and so on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#909cdd54-938c-4e1c-bcbc-055525b4dc0b)  ^909cdd54

> I use an "+Admin" project as a catch-all for the odds and ends that don't belong in an actual work project, such as signing up for benefits. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#bfb7781b-9058-4346-abce-df8105a79f93)  ^bfb7781b

> At these points, what my task list and its priorities are telling me I cannot work on anything important, or that everything is top priority. Neither helps me decide what I should do next. In both cases, the priority system failed, which to me is worse than not helpful, it is demotivating. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#eb8472a1-8993-4fe5-8124-fe021c7a7981)  ^eb8472a1

> My Todo.txt priorities are _my_ priorities, not "how important" the task is. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#77092cc5-8636-4c5f-991f-e167da1f854d)  ^77092cc5

> Here is how I use Todo.txt priorities:
> 
> * **A**: The task I am working on now. My current or next action. Ideally, I will always have only one task in category A. Why do I bother with this? I get interrupted at work and have to return to what I was working on, sometimes minutes or hours later. Having my current action split out and at the top of my to-do list helps me get back on track more quickly.
> * **B**: Tasks that I plan to do today.
> * **C**: Tasks that I plan to do this week.
> * **D**: Tasks reserved for next week. I tend to use this category only on Fridays, and even then almost never use it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#44e7abf5-256b-4b5f-b28d-230e8d0d3fec)  ^44e7abf5

> Shifting priorities around using the keyboard works much faster than setting due dates and clicking on stars or other priority markers I have used in other task lists. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#0dbb307d-2352-426c-9b70-f0854aad90f7)  ^0dbb307d

> Getting Things Done tends to make you believe that every "next action" must be tagged with both a project and a context, but that is not really true. If contexts are critical to you, use them. If not, don't. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#1e2a81b8-d012-4a51-83cd-e353ff4c55fb)  ^1e2a81b8

> Your task list should be tailored to your needs, and help you do work, not be too much work in and of itself. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/http-plaintext-productivity-net-1-03-how-i-organize-my-todo-txt--18b6726d4e8#eff6f8d8-0fe3-45a6-94fd-2a3ff3d82712)  ^eff6f8d8
