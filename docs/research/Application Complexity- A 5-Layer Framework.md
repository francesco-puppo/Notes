## Highlights

> **Integrative complexity** refers to the complexity of underlying technology, such as the interconnection of multiple and variable (often legacy) back-end systems or databases that support an application. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#211f042f-6fe3-4a10-be84-3dfeddd12959)  ^211f042f

> integrative complexity often manifests in poor UX for end users — namely, slow, manual processes such as tedious data transfer and data entry for users who must reference different systems or platforms in order to make comparisons or inquiries. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#fdb3eaa7-3dd5-4773-a4f6-155a9b3ee37d)  ^fdb3eaa7

> Integrative complexity often results from the integration and layering of several disparate legacy architectures and platforms, in an effort to combine several formerly distinct products or capabilities into one product or piece together an interface to represent a single point of access to various subsystems. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#a23df7ff-6253-4fc8-8395-8a65eadf8075)  ^a23df7ff

> **Information complexity** refers to the data volume inherent in many complex applications and the interaction behaviors (e.g., exploring, filtering, zooming and modeling) required to navigate and analyze such data sets. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#3518de8f-e4d1-490b-b676-1d3ce74bb1f6)  ^3518de8f

> When the presented data is not organized or sorted in a way that supports the workflow of the domain expert, clutter and confusion ensue. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#1a74fa16-5efc-4044-858d-65b92dcf3fc4)  ^1a74fa16

> In addition to navigating high volumes of data, the workflows of expert or specialized users often involve building and analyzing complex data models and what-if scenarios. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#46e29dcf-9cb0-487a-ab7c-1e72875a3697)  ^46e29dcf

> The effects of information complexity, such as sustained waiting periods and the propensity for unexpected analysis results, can create uncertainty and lack of confidence in complex-application usage. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#1b9c5d36-b29d-4234-9b11-1122cb80f096)  ^1b9c5d36

> **Intention complexity** refers tothe complexity associated with supporting the unstructured goals and broad tasks that characterize the usage of complex apps. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#e120e815-886c-4f73-b777-5af06af21209)  ^e120e815

> Workflows for complex problem solving are often nonlinear and variable; there is not always a known, ideal set of subtasks (or “happy path”) that all users follow in order to accomplish a goal and that UX practitioners can easily design for and measure the success of. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#c9af44bb-641a-450f-84be-3826a285c488)  ^c9af44bb

> Designing for this type of flexibility is critical for the success of users who may need to vary their processes, skip around, or change approaches mid workstream, depending on the situation at hand. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#6ddb201c-0ee0-4697-a5f7-9da269ab7daf)  ^6ddb201c

> **Environmental complexity** refers to the physical surroundings of complex-app users. These surroundings are often difficult to understand and design for without first hand, real-time field work. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#9a0b67ec-509c-45c0-a8f1-ec5246028609)  ^9a0b67ec

> The competing environmental elements, interruptions, and distractions for complex-app users are almost impossible for UX practitioners or other domain outsiders to comprehend without onsite observation. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#a83c6740-914a-4cc7-a74f-8bed1c532a6b)  ^a83c6740

> Simply put, practitioners must spend time in the work domain in order to understand the environmental factors bombarding complex-app users.

> Finally, **institutional complexity** refers to the cultural or microsocietal structures that exist within an organization, including norms, attitudes, roles, political tensions, sources of power, and institutionalized ways of doing things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#3429d15e-82e4-4184-a2fe-fd4549d4a48f)  ^3429d15e

> Institutional complexity is difficult to alter; however, UX practitioners should observe the influence of such factors over both the methods and assumptions employed during the design process for complex apps and the end user’s interaction with the application to build comprehensive awareness of the design hurdles they are likely to encounter.

> Rather than either being overwhelmed by complexity or simplifying your lens of context when it comes to complex-application design and usage, use the layers of complexity presented in this article as a framework for breaking down sources of complexity relevant to your work and “seeing the forest for the trees.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/application-complexity-a-5-layer-framework-18bdc649c93#f8cac288-b658-4315-81d7-7be1a201e1bd)  ^f8cac288
