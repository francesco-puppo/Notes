- [Blot](https://blot.im)
	- Build your website from a simple folder containing just text and image files
	- My [personal site](https://iamfran.com) runs on it

## Websites to follow

## Static site generators

Most of these, if not all, cannot be considered entry-level, since they require a technical background of some form.
