# IndieWeb

> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the “corporate web”. [^indie]

[^indie]: [IndieWeb.org](https://indieweb.org/)

## User friendly resources

For real. Nothing complicated [^arcade].

[^arcade]: [The IndieWeb has a user experience problem](https://crashthearcade.com/post/5853/)

- [Blot](https://blot.im): Build your website from a simple folder containing just text and image files
	- My [personal site](https://iamfran.com) runs on it

## Some nice website

- [Robb Knight's website](https://rknight.me) by [Robb Knight](https://social.lol/@robb)
- [A Very Good Blog](https://gkeenan.co/avgb) by [Keenan](https://social.lol/@keenan)
- [Crash the Arcade](https://crashthearcade.com/) by [Mike Haynes](https://social.lol/@mikehaynes)]

## Static site generators

Most of these, if not all, **cannot** be considered entry-level, since they require a technical background of some form. 

- [Static site generators (List)](https://jamstack.org/generators/)
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/): Lots of people I follow use this one
- Hugo: My previous website was built with it and I liked it a lot
- [Blot](https://blot.im): [Notes](/docs/indieweb/blot)
- Jekyll: This website runs on Jekyll
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
