*Keep it simple* is a UX golden rule and it only makes sense that I try and apply it to my personal productivity as well.

- Reduce friction
- Don't overcomplicate things
- Make it easy to maintain

## Apps

This reverberates across all the apps I use:

- [Things 3](/docs/apps/task-managers/things3) fits great in my needs because it offers enough features without allowing you to do *too much*. Follow the basics of the GTD methodology and you're all set.
- Apple default apps, as you can see in my [list of apps](/docs/apps) are often mentioned since they are often able to combine good design with a suitable set of features.
