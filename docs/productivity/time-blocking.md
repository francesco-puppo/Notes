It's clear, after all this time, that what works best for me is a combination of **Time blocking** and **[Deep work](/docs/productivity/deep-work)**.

Time blocking your calendars means pre-filling your days with activities you want to do. The trick here is that you try and fill in as much as possible your weekly view.

While this might sound annoying, time consuming, and limiting the the truth is another one.

Time blocking allows you to save time for what you *actually* want to do and it also helps with planning and getting back control of your life.

## My setup

My setup is extremely basic (I like to [Keep things simple](/docs/productivity/keep-it-simple)) and it's a combination of **Apple Calendar**, **[Things 3](/docs/apps/task-managers/things3)**, **Flow**, and a simple notebook.

Every weekend[^weekend] I sit down and, after reviewing my past week, I quickly plan the upcoming one.

I use a note in Apple Notes to remind myself of the tasks I usually do on a day-to-day basic and I just go through every day, looking at the events that are already scheduled and plan my day around those.

[^weekend]: OK, sometimes even on Monday morning...

At the same time I use Things to list all of my tasks and block time also for those, when needed.\ 
I try to group them if possible, so I may have an event that say *Personal tasks* and, when the time comes, I can filter Things 3 to know what I have to do that day.
