# Meta

This website runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which means it’s basically a collection of markdown files, and is hosted on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/). 

The template I used is called [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/), which I modified a bit. 

I tried to set it up in a way that is easy for me to edit and maintain. [^happy]

## Setup

Everything is hosted on GitHub (in [this repository](https://github.com/francesco-puppo/Notes)) and, locally, I store the project in a folder synced with iCloud.

To edit these files I mainly use Nova or VS Code (see [Text Editors / Code](/docs/apps/text-editors.html#code)), unless I have to write some form of long-text content, in which case I use iA Writer (see [Text Editors / Markdown](/apps/text-editors#markdown)).

## Structure

The structure of the files follow the instructions from Just the Docs and it looks like this:

```
_config.yml
|
_includes
| 
| -- (custom layouts)
| 
_sass
| 
| -- (custom css) 
| 
assets
```

The folder `docs` store all the actual pages in Markdown format. 

I also added it to iA Writer and Obsidian so I am able to edit them from there as well, without the need to navigate through the Finder or open VS Code.

[^happy]: Even if I'm quite happy with the result, I know it could be improved. Unfortunately, I lack the technical skills.
