# Text editors

## Code

- [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html)
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
- [Nova](https://nova.app/)
  - A **beautiful**, native text editor for macOS
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Markdown

Most of the above can also be used for writing in markdown, but these apps are specialised in that (which comes with a lot of benefits):

- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)
	- The most beautiful text editor for macOS
	- Supports wikilinks
	- I often [mention it](https://iamfran.com/search?q=ia+writer) on my blog
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
	- Supports wikilinks
- [MarkEdit](https://github.com/MarkEdit-app/MarkEdit)
	- A very simple and fast editor
	- No library support, but it's great to quickly edit single files
- [Typora](https://typora.io/)
