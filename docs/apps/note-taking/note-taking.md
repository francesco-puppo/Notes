# Note taking

Note taking apps can be divided in:

- **Plain text** editors
	- Don't let the name fool you. A lot can be done with just plain text and some magic (see [Plain text files](/docs/file-management/plain-text-files))
- **Rich text** editors
- **Block based** editors
	- The new kid on the block, with [Notion](/docs/apps/notion) and [Craft](/docs/apps/craft) on the front-line.
- **Infinite lists**
		- A concept that I love but unfortunately has not many apps developed around it.
