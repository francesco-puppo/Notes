# Bear

Bear is a markdown editor for Apple devices.

## What makes it unique

Bear has a unique way of handling tags that allows to create a complex structure just by adding tags to your files.

It's an app designed for Apple devices. This means no Electron or web-app feeling. You get a **premium experience**** with it. 

## What works well

-   Bear is a pleasure to use, on every platform
-   Its unique way of handling tags like folder allows for very easy and flexible organisation
-   The keyboard shortcuts make sense[^key]

[^key]: Not like in Apple Notes, for example

## What could be improved

-   The sidebar can easily become messy and tags can be hard to read, since spaces or capital letters can’t be used
- The archive feature is basically pointless, since it "deactivates" the tags when notes are stored there. 

## It's for you if

-   You love well crafted, native apps
-   Apple Notes doesn't satisfy you and you want something similar but more powerful and flexible
-   You want to set up a [simple yet flexible Zettelkasten](https://mindfulteacher.substack.com/p/why-bear-is-my-zettelkasten)

## It's NOT for you if

-   You prefer to _own_ your files, even if it has great export features, Bear still maintains all files in a private library that is not integrated with the Finder.
-   You get triggered when things are not formatted the way you want (I’m talking about the sidebar here).
