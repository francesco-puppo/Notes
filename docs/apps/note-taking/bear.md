# Bear

Bear is a markdown editor for Apple devices.

## What makes it unique

## What works well

- Bear is a pleasure to use, on every platform
- It’s unique way of handling tags like folder allows for very easy and flexible organisation
- The keyboard shortcuts make sense[^key]

[^key]: Not like in Apple Notes, for example

## What could be improved

- The sidebar can easily become messy and tags can be hard to read, since spaces or capital letters can’t be used

## It's for you if

- You love well crafted, native apps
- Apple Notes doesn't satisfy you and you want something similar but more powerful and flexible
- You want to set up a [simple yet flexible Zettelkasten](https://mindfulteacher.substack.com/p/why-bear-is-my-zettelkasten)

## It's NOT for you if

- You prefer to *own* your files, even if it has great export features, Bear still maintains all files in a private library that is not integrated with the Finder
