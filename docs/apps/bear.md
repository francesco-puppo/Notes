# Bear

Bear is a markdown editor for Apple devices.

## What makes it unique

## What works well

- Bear is a pleasure to use, on every platform
- It’s unique way of handling tags like folder allows for very easy and flexible organisation
- The keyboard shortcuts make sense[^key]

[^key]: Not like in Apple Notes, for example

## What could be improved

- The sidebar can easily become messy and tags can be hard to read, since spaces or capital letters can’t be used

## Why use it



## Why not use it

- If you prefer to *own* your files, even if it has great export features, Bear still maintains all files in a private library that is not integrated with the Finder
