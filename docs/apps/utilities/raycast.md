Raycast is a powerful alternative to Spotlight.

When replacing Spotlight, you can summon it by clicking <kbd>⌘</kbd> + `space`.

## How I use it

### Default features

- **Calendar:** See your schedule without having to open the Calendar app.
- **Color picker:** Pick a color from the screen without having to take screenshots or open another app
- **Navigation / Search menu items:** Instantly search across all menu commands available for the focused app[^menu]
- **Quicklinks:** I have a series of searches tied to some websites to quickly search in them
- **Search emoji & symbols**: Much faster than macOS default shortcut
- **Window management:** Raycast replaced the app I previously used since I can add keyboard shortcuts to these commands
- **Word search**

[^menu]: I tied this to the <kbd>⌥</kbd> + `space` combination
